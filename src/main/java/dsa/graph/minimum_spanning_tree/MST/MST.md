-connects all vertices together
-no cycle
-minimum total edge

Real life problem
- connect five island with bridges
- the cost of bridges between island varies based on different factors
- which bridge should be constructed so that all islands are accessible and the cost is minimum

Difference between Single Source Shortest path and Minimum Spanning Tree
MST finds the cheapest way connecting the all sources
SSSPP finds the source vertex and then finds the cheapest from that source

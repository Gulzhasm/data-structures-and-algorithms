Graph Terminology

- Vertices-vertex: are the nodes of the graph
- Edge: the edge is the line that connects pairs of vertices
- Unweighted graph: A graph which does not have a weighted associated with any edge
- Weighted graph: A graph which has a weight associated with any edge
- undirected graph: In case of edges of the graph do not have a direction associated with them
- directed graph: if the edges in a graph have a direction associated with them
- cyclic graph: A graph which has at least one loop
- acyclic graph: A graph with no loop
- Tree: It is a special case of directed acyclic graphs

Graph types:

Graph
Directed and Undirected
Weighted and Unweighted
Positive and Negative

1. Unweighted - undirected graph
no direction and no weights 
2. Unweighted - directed
there are directions with arrows, but with no weights
3. Positive - weighted - undirected
no arrows that shows the direction with weights
4. Positive - weighted - directed
There are directions with weights
5. Negative - weighted - undirected
if the weight numbers are negative numbers, that can be negative graph
6. Negative - weighted - directed

Array List

1. Size is not fixed, -> but the size is fixed internally
2. Array List fills by some amount -> it will create a new list or elements of lists are copied into the new list, old one is deleted
// 1 2 3 4 - > 1 2 3 4 23 23 23 23  -> so initial array list copied into a new list 

3. primitive data types are not accepted
